Part III

Interaction and

Communication

between Programs

To this point in our study of computer systems, we have assumed that programs run in isolation, with minimal input and output. However, in the real world, application programs use services provided by the operating system to communicate with I/O devices and with other programs.

This part of the book will give you an understanding of the basic I/O services provided by Unix operating systems and how to use these services to build applications such as Web clients and servers that communicate with each other over the Internet. You will learn techniques for writing concurrent programs, such as Web servers that can service multiple clients at the same time. Writing concurrent application programs can also allow them to execute faster on modern multi-core processors. When you finish this part, you will be well on your way to becoming a power programmer with a mature understanding of computer systems and their impact on your programs.

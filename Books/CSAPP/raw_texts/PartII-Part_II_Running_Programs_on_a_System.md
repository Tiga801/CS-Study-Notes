# Part II

# Running Programs on a System

Our exploration of computer systems continues with a closer look at the systems software that builds and runs application programs. The linker combines different parts of our programs into a single file that can be loaded into memory and executed by the processor. Modern operating systems cooperate with the hardware to provide each program with the illusion that it has exclusive use of a processor and the main memory, when in reality multiple programs are running on the system at any point in time.

In the first part of this book, you developed a good understanding of the interaction between your programs and the hardware. Part II of the book will broaden your view of systems by giving you a solid understanding of the interactions between your programs and the operating system. You will learn how to use services provided by the operating system to build system-level programs such as Unix shells and dynamic memory allocation packages.
